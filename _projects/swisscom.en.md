Swisscom is the leading telecommunications- and one of the leading IT-companies in Switzerland. Swisscom is for many Swiss customers a trusted companion in the digital world. Swisscom's goal is to inspire clients with the best network, excellent offers and outstanding services. 

Technological change, intense local and global competition as well as changing customer requirements are resulting in the constant lowering of prices as well as volume for classic business models with user related offers. With a long-term strategy, Swisscom plans to compensate the decline in turnover and results, in order to conserve the financing for the high investments into new technologies. Part of this strategy is investing in new and innovative technologies such as big data and NoSQUL information systems. Scigility supports the big data delivery team. 


* With sourcing data from the data lake 
* With a generic (ELT) transformation tool on Hadoop and Kafka
* With the integration of data from the data lake into the data warehouse 
* With the development of a global delivery framework for big data, based on agile continuation principles
