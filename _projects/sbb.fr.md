The SBB maintains a permanently growing track system with currently about 3200 kilometres; that transports 365 million people and over 48 million tons of freight per year. Such a track system must constantly be serviced and monitored. For this task, the SBB uses special measuring trains with various sensors that are able to assess the condition of track sections with diagnosis journeys. 


Scigility delivers a software solution that allows for the data collected during these measuring trips to be made plausible and possible erroneous data to be corrected. It especially permits the integration of DSL-Scripts, so that the experts from the SBB and concentrate on their main competencies and the analysis of the data and be processed efficiently. A helpful consequence is a reduction of "false alarms" that would lead to the follow-up inspection of tracks for non-existant issues.
