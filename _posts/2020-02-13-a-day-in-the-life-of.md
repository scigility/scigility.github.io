Regular conversation that Scigility engineers (_SE_) have in their free time with random strangers (_RS_):
- _RS: Hey what do you actually do for a living?_
- SE: I work at Scigility – we're a small technology consulting company, leading experts in the Big Data space, and helping companies all over Switzerland, Austria and Germany.
- _RS: Ah I see, Big Data - that's just installing large databases then, right?_
- SE: ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ
- SE: ʕノ•ᴥ•ʔノ ︵ ┻━┻

Are you interested in our company and wondering what we _actually_ do each day? Here's some example of projects we're currently working on:
- Building an on-premise Cloudera Hadoop cluster from scratch, with every installation task neatly automatized with Ansible. While building the cluster, we're constantly working together with the on-site DevOps staff and training them so they're actually capable of maintaining the cluster afterwards.
- Helping customers defining processes to not loose oversight over all of their data: CI/CD for regular software is widely adopted and in place, but have you thought about how to handle _data_ across different stages from test to staging to production?
- Implementing a data integration layer from scratch with Kafka and MinIO, that is able to move data of arbitrary size from a wide variety of sources to destinations (Avro streams, REST APIs, directories of files, email, SFTPs, ...). Making sure the solution is easily maintainable by setting up Jenkins pipelines that automatically deploy changes, using Ansible playbooks and a containerized microservices architecture on top of a Kubernetes platform.
- Building machine learning pipelines that can label pictures across hierarchies of categories with high accuracy, and putting the pipeline into production as a dockerized application on the customer's platform.
- Putting existing Python notebooks into production with Apache Airflow (see Christian's post for details: [Azure Databricks & Apache Airflow - a perfect match for production](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/azure-databricks-apache-airflow-perfect-match-production-g%C3%BCgi/)).
