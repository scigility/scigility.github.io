## Digitalization in the era of GDPR
### powered by Scigility, Cloudera, Neo4j and sigma legal

Digitalization is a key driver for future business and a competitive advantage for companies today. Data is the key asset to drive digitalization and help to understand your customers, your competitors, your market and yourself. With data new products and services can be created that disrupt traditional business and industries.

On the other hand, data is an asset that has different characteristics than traditional assets and therefore new methodologies and techniques play a key success factor to value data. Further, data and its usage is very sensitive in regard to understand your environment. GDPR is a legal frame work that tries to increase transparency and standards how personal data can be used and impacts Digitalization.

During this event we provide you an overview how modern information platforms and clouds can be used to empower you towards digitalization, how a modern data governance and data management can help you to be compliant to the new regulations.

After this event you will be aware of general methods and techniques how to precess data in a modern way and we show you a framework that allows you to be compliant with GDPR and and be prepared to your future challenges for data governance.
